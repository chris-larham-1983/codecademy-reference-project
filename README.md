## General Information
This is my solution to the *Codecademy* project challenge wherein we had to create a 'cheat sheet' reference on a 
topic of our choosing. I chose to research the topic of *CSS selectors*; the information found at 
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp served as the basis for this project.  

The project requirements were as follows:

- Document at least one HTML or CSS topic
- Use HTML tables to display the documentation
- Label the columns in the HTML table
- Utilize a custom color scheme
- Use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags
- Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background colour

## Technologies
I completed this project using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  I used some new *CSS selectors* in my own stylesheet, to 
implement the knowledge I had gained while researching this topic.

## Setup
Simply clone this project to the directory of your choice, navigate to the downloaded project, and double-click the 
'index.html' file.
